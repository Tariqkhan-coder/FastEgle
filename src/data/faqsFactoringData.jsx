    question: "What is truck factoring?",
    answer:
      "Truck factoring is when a trucking business sells its unpaid freight bills for cash. Without waiting 30-60 days for customer payments, truck factoring gives fast funding for gasoline, repairs, and payroll. Trucking operations can maintain cash flow and prevent financial strain by having the factoring provider collect customer payments later.",
